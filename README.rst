Obsidian Moon Engine v1.0.0 Documentation
=========================================
This is a project that I have worked on for several months after being inspired by CodeIgniter.
After setting up the initial steps of the system I am opening the project up for open source.
Feel free to contribute and peer review my work, please not that there are a few pieces that are based on CodeIgniter that need to be worked on.

Instructions for Installation
=============================

You will need a few things for this to work correctly: 
	
1) This code 
2) Hosting with PHP support

You will need to place the ``obsidian-moon`` folder in the ``/home/cpaneluser/`` directory also known as ``~/``

Create a folder that will hold the contents of application folder, and ensure that it is a document root for better results.
The sub folder feature needs to be worked on.

Instructions for Using Obsidian Moon
====================================

You will find that the Obsidian Moon engine is 100% modular and will expand as you build code into it. Feel free to add modules, tweak the code and 
add features I have not thought of, however please give credit by placing "Powered by Obsidian Moon" if you do use the engine. And if you make code that 
improves on what I have now, feel free to share back! Thanks and Enjoy!
